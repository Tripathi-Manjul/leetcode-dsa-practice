        Finds the maximum water a container can store, using two-pointer approach.

        Args:
        height (List[int]): Heights of vertical lines on the x-axis.

        Returns:
        int: Maximum water that can be stored.

        Approach:
        - Initialize two pointers at the start and end of the array.
        - Calculate area formed by lines at these pointers.
        - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward.
        - Repeat until pointers meet.

        Time Complexity: O(n)
        Space Complexity: O(1)
